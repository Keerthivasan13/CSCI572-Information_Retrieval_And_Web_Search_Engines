From the statistics, we can observe that there is 32 % of overlap between the results from Google(Reference) and Bing. Even though overlaps are present, the correlation(rho) of the overlapping result rankings from the two Search Engines is not positive. The average value of Spearman's coeffiecient is -6.67 and we can conclude that its likely that Bing's rankings will have a different order than that of Google's but Bing will fetch relevant results for 32% of the time.
